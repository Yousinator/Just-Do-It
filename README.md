# DSA To-Do-List

## Objectives List

### 1. Data Structures Implementation

- [ ] Develop a LinkedList to store the entire to-do list.
- [ ] Implement a queue to manage tasks to be completed.
- [ ] Use a stack to store urgent tasks.
- [ ] Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) to filter tasks by category.

### 2. Task Management

- [ ] Implement functionality to allow users to add tasks with required details.
- [ ] Ensure tasks can be assigned priorities and categorized.
- [ ] Allow users to mark tasks as completed.
- [ ] Maintain a history of completed tasks for review.

### 3. Task Sorting and Retrieval

- [ ] Implement sorting of tasks by due date using the LinkedList.
- [ ] Provide functionality to filter and display only urgent tasks using the stack.
- [ ] Enable sorting and displaying tasks by category using the Binary Search Tree (BST).

### 4. User Interface

- [ ] Develop a simple Java GUI to add, view, and manage tasks.
- [ ] Provide options to filter tasks by due date, priority, and category.

## Implementation Plan


### 1. Design Application Architecture

- [ ] Define classes and data structures for tasks, including fields for name, due date, priority, and category.
- [ ] Plan the overall architecture, focusing on the Java GUI interface and data structures.

### 2. Data Structures Development

- [ ] Develop a LinkedList class to manage the entire to-do list.
- [ ] Implement a queue class to handle tasks to be completed.
- [ ] Develop a stack class to manage urgent tasks.
- [ ] Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) class to filter tasks by category.

### 3. Develop Core Features

- [ ] Implement task addition functionality using the LinkedList.
- [ ] Develop methods for marking tasks as completed and storing completed tasks in a queue.
- [ ] Implement sorting and retrieval functionalities using the LinkedList for due dates, stack for urgent tasks, and BST for categories.

### 4. Java GUI Interface Development

- [ ] Design and implement the Java GUI interface for adding, viewing, and managing tasks.
- [ ] Ensure the interface is intuitive and easy to use.

### 5. Testing and Validation

- [ ] Write and execute test cases for all functionalities.
- [ ] Validate input data and ensure proper error handling.
